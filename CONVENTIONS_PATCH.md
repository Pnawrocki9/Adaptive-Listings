# Conventions Patch — Estalara Adaptive Listings

Permanent rules codified from lessons learned. Rules A–F come from Paczka 1 retrospective. Rules G+
are added by the `retrospective-analyst` agent when the same finding pattern appears in ≥2
per-ticket retrospectives (RULE_PROMOTION_THRESHOLD = 2).

**This file is authoritative.** When a rule here conflicts with older prose in CLAUDE.md, this file
wins. PM orchestrator includes the current rules in every worker delegation prompt.

---

## Rule A — Always verify CI green before READY_FOR_REVIEW

**Pattern:** Marking ticket READY_FOR_REVIEW based only on local test pass, without waiting for
GitHub Actions CI to complete.

**Evidence:** Paczka 1 TICKET-001 (original failure mode documented in pm-orchestrator.md)

**Rule:** PM-orchestrator MUST run `gh pr checks <pr-number> --watch` and wait for completion before
marking any ticket READY_FOR_REVIEW. Local tests passing ≠ CI passing. This step is non-negotiable
even if the worker reports "all tests pass."

**Verification:**

```bash
gh pr checks <pr-number> --json state,name | jq '[.[] | select(.state != "SUCCESS")] | length'
# Must return 0
```

---

## Rule B — Run prettier on every file you edit, every time

**Pattern:** Skipping prettier re-run on previously formatted files, causing CI format check
failures on unchanged-looking code.

**Evidence:** Paczka 1 format CI failures across multiple tickets

**Rule:** Run `pnpm prettier --write <file>` on every file you touch, on every edit, even if you ran
it earlier in the session. CI format check is strict and catches any divergence.

**Verification:**

```bash
pnpm prettier --check .
# Must return exit 0
```

---

## Rule C — Check repo-config dependencies BEFORE opening PR

**Pattern:** Merging a workflow that requires Code Scanning, GitHub Secrets, or branch protection
rules that don't exist, causing CI to fail in a way that can't be fixed by code changes alone.

**Evidence:** Paczka 1 CodeQL workflow added without Code Scanning enabled in repo settings

**Rule:** Before opening a PR that adds or modifies `.github/workflows/*.yml`, verify that every
required repo setting, secret, or permission already exists. If it doesn't → write to
`backlog/ESCALATIONS.md` BEFORE opening the PR, not after CI fails. Do not push the workflow file
until the human has confirmed the setting is active.

**Verification:** Review `.github/workflows/` diff manually against available repo settings.

---

## Rule D — Python build-backend must be setuptools.build_meta

**Pattern:** Using `setuptools.backends.legacy` as the pyproject.toml build-backend, which does not
exist and causes packaging failures.

**Evidence:** Paczka 1 Python app packaging failures

**Rule:** In every `pyproject.toml`, the build-backend MUST be exactly `setuptools.build_meta`.
Also: every Python app needs `__init__.py` in `src/` (even if empty) for the package to be
importable.

**Verification:**

```bash
grep -r "build-backend" apps/ --include="pyproject.toml"
# All results must say: build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
```

---

## Rule E — pnpm version belongs in package.json, not in CI

**Pattern:** Setting `version:` in the `pnpm/action-setup@v4` CI step, which overrides
`packageManager` in `package.json` and causes version mismatch errors.

**Evidence:** Paczka 1 CI pnpm version conflicts

**Rule:** The pnpm version is declared once, in the root `package.json` under `packageManager`. The
`pnpm/action-setup@v4` step in CI MUST NOT include a `version:` key — it reads from `packageManager`
automatically.

**Verification:**

```bash
grep -A3 "pnpm/action-setup" .github/workflows/*.yml
# Must NOT contain "version:" key
```

---

## Rule F — Slot names must be canonical: headline, cta, feature

**Pattern:** Using non-canonical slot names (e.g., `feature-section`) in playbook archetype files,
causing SDK query selector mismatches and silent slot injection failures.

**Evidence:** TICKET-046 / PR #92 — `yield-hunter.ts` had `feature-section` instead of `feature`,
also present in `llm-gateway.ts` prompt string

**Rule:** The three canonical slot names are `headline`, `cta`, `feature`. Any other value is a bug.
When adding a new slot or archetype, validate the name against this list. The LLM gateway prompt
strings listing available slots must also use these exact names.

**Verification:**

```bash
grep -rn "feature-section" packages/sdk/src/core/playbooks/ apps/control-plane/src/
# Must return 0 results
```

---

## Rule G — Breaking type changes require grep for inline mock objects

**Pattern:** Adding a required field to a shared TypeScript type (e.g., making `copy_template`
required on `PlaybookEntry`) without scanning all files that construct inline mock objects of that
type, leaving test mocks incomplete and causing typecheck failures in CI.

**Evidence:** TICKET-046 / PR #92 — `MOCK_PLAYBOOK` in `llm-gateway.test.ts` failed typecheck after
`copy_template` became required on `PlaybookEntry`; RETRO-001 identified this pattern

**Rule:** When making a field required (removing `?`) or adding a new required field to any exported
type in `packages/shared/` or `packages/sdk/`, IMMEDIATELY run:

```bash
grep -rn "TypeName" packages/ apps/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | grep -v "import"
```

Find all inline object constructions of that type and update them before opening the PR.

**Verification:**

```bash
pnpm typecheck
# Must return exit 0 — catches all incomplete mock objects
```

---

## Rule H — Schema scaffold MUST ship with at least one runtime-wired consumer

**Pattern:** Adding a database table, event schema, or library module without wiring it into a
production request path — leaving the new surface as dead code at runtime while tests pass in
isolation. The downstream consumer ticket then merges assuming the wiring exists, compounding the
gap. Symptoms include: schema file + unit tests + zero non-test importers, OR Zod event schema
registered in the event union but no producer call site, OR mock API route shipped with a comment
"real implementation in TICKET-X" but TICKET-X never replaces the mock.

**Evidence:**

- RETRO-001 / TICKET-046 (PR #92): `PlaybookEntry.variants[]` shipped + `ab_bandit_weights.variant`
  column present, but Decision API never selects between variants (`variant_index` always 0;
  variant_0/1/2 seed rows never inserted). → FOLLOW-001.
- RETRO-001 / TICKET-046 (PR #92): `PlaybookEntry.copy_template.en` field added to all 17
  non-neutral archetypes, but `GET /api/adapt/description` endpoint, Modal
  `generate_description.py`, and the Redis cache layer described in Master Design E.7 do not exist —
  `copy_template` is unreachable. → FOLLOW-002.
- RETRO-002 / TICKET-AB-001 (PR #80): `AbAssignmentEventSchema` registered in shared event union but
  no producer call emits the event from the adapt route. → FOLLOW-006.
- RETRO-002 / TICKET-AB-001 (PR #80): `apps/decision-api/src/lib/bandit.ts` exports
  `thompsonSample()` + Beta utilities, fully unit-tested, but imported by zero non-test files. The
  adapt route still uses keyword `detectArchetype()`. → FOLLOW-007.
- RETRO-002 / TICKET-AB-001 (PR #80): `ab_bandit_weights` Postgres table created with RLS but zero
  rows seeded for the 18 archetypes — table is schema-only. → FOLLOW-008.
- RETRO-002 / TICKET-AB-001 (PR #80): ClickHouse `adaptation_decisions.holdout_group` column
  migration applied, but the writer that populates `adaptation_decisions` was not updated; every row
  takes the column default `false`. → FOLLOW-010.
- RETRO-002 / TICKET-AB-001 → TICKET-AB-004 cascade: `/api/ab/weights` shipped as a mock with a
  comment "real Drizzle queries will replace this in TICKET-AB-004", but AB-004 (PR #99) merged
  without touching the file. The analytics dashboard now renders fabricated data. → FOLLOW-014.

**Rule:** Every ticket that adds a new schema, Zod type, exported library module, DB table, or
event-union member MUST include at least one of the following in the same PR:

1. **A production consumer call site** — at minimum, one non-test file in `apps/` imports the new
   symbol and uses it on a hot path. Verified by
   `grep -rn '<symbol_name>' apps/ --include='*.ts' | grep -v __tests__ | grep -v node_modules`.
   Must return ≥1 match outside the defining file.
2. **An integration test that proves end-to-end wiring** — for event schemas: a test that mounts the
   producing route and asserts the event reached a mock consumer. For library modules: a test that
   imports through the consuming route, not the module directly. For DB tables: a test that asserts
   seed/insert via the consuming code, not a raw INSERT.
3. **An explicit, dated deferral in the ticket spec + a corresponding FOLLOW-NNN stub created in the
   same PR.** If wiring genuinely cannot land in this ticket, the deferral must be written into the
   AC list (NOT only the context body) and a follow-up stub must be added to `backlog/FOLLOW_UPS.md`
   in the same commit, with `recommended_sprint` set to the next sprint.

Mock API routes are allowed only when (3) is satisfied AND the route file's header comment includes
the target follow-up ID (e.g. `// MVP stub — replaced by FOLLOW-014`). The reviewer MUST verify the
follow-up exists before approving.

**Hard gate (CI + pre-push):** `scripts/check-rule-h.sh` runs as a blocking CI job (`rule-h` in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) and as a `pre-push` lefthook. Exit code 1 = PR blocked. The script
checks:

1. Any API route file changed in the PR that contains `MVP stub` / `mock data` /
   `real impl in TICKET-` MUST include a `FOLLOW-NNN` reference, and that stub MUST exist in
   `backlog/FOLLOW_UPS.md`. No FOLLOW-NNN → CI fails.
2. Any newly created `lib/*.ts` file MUST have at least one non-test importer in `apps/` or
   `packages/`. Zero importers → CI fails.

Run locally before pushing:

```bash
bash scripts/check-rule-h.sh origin/main
```

## Rule I — Wired-or-dead: every exported symbol must have a non-test importer

**Pattern:** A ticket ships a new exported symbol (function, class, constant, type) with unit tests
that import it directly, but zero non-test files in `apps/` or `packages/` import it. The symbol is
effectively dead code at runtime; tests give a false sense of coverage.

**Evidence:** Multiple RETRO entries (see Rule H evidence). Pattern is distinct from Rule H (which
gates PR-diff additions); Rule I gates the whole codebase continuously via CI.

**Rule:** A ticket CANNOT be marked DONE if its primary artifact has zero non-test importers. The
reviewer MUST verify at least one non-test file imports the new symbol before approving. If only
test files import it, the ticket reverts to IN_PROGRESS and a wire-up follow-up is required.

**Hard gate (CI):** `scripts/check-rule-i.sh` runs as a blocking CI job (`rule-i` in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) after lint, before tests. Exit code 1 = PR blocked. The script scans all
`export` declarations in `packages/*/src` and `apps/*/src` (excluding test files) and fails if any
exported symbol has zero non-test importers anywhere in the repo.

Run locally before pushing:

```bash
bash scripts/check-rule-i.sh
```

## Rule J — Mirror-code sync gate for cross-runtime duplicates

**Pattern:** A piece of business logic must run in two runtimes (Cloudflare Worker bundle and
Next.js Edge / Node) that cannot share a workspace package at runtime. The codebase responds by
duplicating the file in both `apps/decision-api/src/lib/<x>.ts` and either `packages/shared/src/` or
`apps/control-plane/src/`. The PR description says "kept in sync" or "byte-identical" but no CI gate
enforces this. The next person to patch one side and forget the other introduces silent divergence
that only manifests when one runtime hits a code path the other doesn't have. Tests on each side
pass independently because they exercise the local copy.

**Evidence:**

- RETRO-003 / TICKET-REORDER-001 (PR #91): `buildReorderDirective()` reorder logic mirrored between
  `apps/decision-api/src/lib/reorder.ts` and `apps/control-plane/src/app/api/adapt/route.ts` with no
  enforcement (FOLLOW-015 wired the Worker side later, but the duplication itself was unaddressed).
- RETRO-005 / FOLLOW-007 (PR #122): `thompsonSample()` / `sampleBeta()` / `updateBanditArm()`
  duplicated between `packages/shared/src/bandit.ts` (canonical) and
  `apps/decision-api/src/lib/bandit.ts` (byte-identical Worker copy). PR description explicitly
  documents the "sync requirement" but ships no CI gate.
- RETRO-005 / FOLLOW-019 (PR #123): cosine math + `buildReorderDirective()` + `affinityScore()`
  duplicated between `apps/decision-api/src/lib/reorder.ts` and
  `apps/control-plane/src/app/api/adapt/route.ts`. Pattern repeats within the same sprint, twice.

**Rule:** Every file in `apps/decision-api/src/lib/` that is documented as a mirror of another file
(canonical source declared in a top-of-file JSDoc comment) MUST be enforced by a CI gate that fails
on byte (or AST) drift. A `MIRROR_FILES` manifest lives at `scripts/mirror-files.json` declaring the
pairs; `scripts/check-mirror-files.sh` reads the manifest, compares the file pairs, and fails CI on
mismatch.

Allowed strategies for keeping the manifest small:

1. **Byte-identical:** strictly identical file contents (fastest check; brittle to JSDoc edits).
2. **AST-equivalent:** compares stripped AST (TypeScript compiler API) — allows JSDoc, comment, and
   whitespace divergence; requires the actual exported symbols + bodies to match.
3. **Snapshot-tested:** both files' exported behavior is exercised by a single shared test fixture
   suite (`packages/shared/__tests__/cross-runtime/*.test.ts`) that imports each and asserts
   byte-identical outputs across N input cases — useful when type signatures differ slightly but
   semantics must match (e.g., Worker has no `Buffer`, Node does).

The PR adding a new mirrored file MUST also add the pair to `mirror-files.json` and choose a
strategy. PRs that touch one side of a mirrored pair MUST touch the other side in the same commit —
failing CI on a one-sided edit is the entire point.

**Verification:**

```bash
bash scripts/check-mirror-files.sh
# Must return exit 0
```

Implementation tracked in FOLLOW-052 (Sprint 10). Until landed, the rule is enforced by manual
review against the manifest stub at `scripts/mirror-files.json`.
